						<h1>Internet of Things</h1>
						<p>The Internet of things, or IoT, is a device-related system
							computers, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are equipped with unique identifiers and can transform data through networks without human-to-human or human-computer interaction.</p>
						<p class="kol">There are multiple definitions, but perhaps more simply, IoT refers to the increasing trend of connecting everyday objects to the Internet. IoT is the future of the internet as it will make everyday life easier for people.</p>

						<p>This innovative technology has been implemented around the world for some time and is helping to develop the so-called "smart cities". Internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, an automobile that has sensors built to alert the driver when the tire pressure is low, cell phones, thermostat at coffee machines, refrigerators or objects created by the person who can be assigned to an IP address and is able to transfer data to a network.

						<p>One of the cities that qualifies as the smartest is Singapore, which everyday is increasing the usage of IoT. Singapore has managed to reduce the gas of cars due to the app that citizens use to find free parking space, and has also managed to reduce the garbage through an app used by companies to know which containers are full of garbage and have need to be released immediately. IoT is also used for homes where applications can turn on or off any electronic device.
